# React Native Assignment 3 - 11135953

## Description

This repository contains my submission for React Native Assignment 3. The assignment required us to recreate a given UI design, use all the core components, include at least eight categories, provide a list of 15 ongoing tasks, style the application to closely match the provided UI design, and use custom components throughout the application.

## Components Used

### View
A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. It's a basic building block of a React Native app's UI.

### Text
Used to display text in a React Native app. It's similar to a `p` or `span` element in HTML.

### ScrollView
Enables scrolling through child components. It's useful when you have a lot of content that doesn't fit on the screen, and you want the user to be able to scroll through it.

### TextInput
Used to input text in a React Native app. It's similar to an `input` element in HTML.

### Stylesheet
A way to define styles for your React Native app. You can use it to create a separate file for your styles, making it easier to manage and reuse them throughout your app.

### Button
Used to create a button in a React Native app. It's similar to a `button` element in HTML.

### FlatList
Renders a simple, flat list of data. It's useful when you have a large dataset and want to display it in a list format.

### Image
Used to display images in a React Native app. It's similar to an `img` element in HTML.
